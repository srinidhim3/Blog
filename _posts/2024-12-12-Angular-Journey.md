With a decade of experience in database engineering, primarily using SQL and Python, I recently found myself venturing into the world of Angular. The reason? A potential project requiring UI development. As I embarked on this new learning journey, I quickly realized that Angular is a complex and, at times, chaotic language.

Initially, I struggled to understand which parts of the code were responsible for specific elements in the UI. The sheer number of files to track was overwhelming. Seeking guidance, I consulted with several experts at work, who recommended a Udemy tutorial. I dedicated weeks to this course, meticulously writing every line of code demonstrated.

However, when I attempted to develop my own component, I hit a roadblock. The frameworks and themes used at work were vastly different from those in the tutorial. After a few days of frustration, I finally managed to build a component that adhered to our standards.

Despite this small victory, I still don't feel confident enough to claim proficiency in Angular, let alone add it to my skill set. Now, with my regular work assignments back on my plate, I'm unsure of the next steps in my Angular journey.
